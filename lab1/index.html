            <h2>Flowers</h2>
                <p>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants(plants of the division Angiospermae). 
                Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower.</p>

            <h2>Plants</h2>
                <p style="background-color:rgb(104, 186, 104);">Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic.
                This means that they obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce sugars from carbon dioxide.</p>
